# Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with LoRA

## Overview

This README provides guidance on using the accompanying Jupyter notebook, which demonstrates **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for fine-tuning a pretrained GPT-2 model efficiently. LoRA reduces memory usage and computational costs by freezing most model parameters and training small, low-rank matrices.

## Introduction

Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive, especially for users with limited hardware resources. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** provides an efficient solution by freezing most of the model's parameters and introducing trainable, low-rank matrices to adapt the model for new tasks.

This notebook will guide you through:
- Understanding how LoRA modifies the model architecture.
- Fine-tuning a GPT-2 model using LoRA.
- Tokenizing and preprocessing datasets for efficient training.
- Visualizing the training loss to evaluate performance.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure that you have:
- A basic understanding of machine learning concepts.
- Familiarity with the **transformers** library by Hugging Face.
- Experience with large language models and fine-tuning techniques.

Additionally, access to a GPU-enabled environment is recommended, as fine-tuning large models requires substantial computational resources.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets peft matplotlib
```

## Usage Guide

Follow these steps to run the notebook:

### Step 1: Load Pretrained GPT-2 Model and Tokenizer
- The notebook loads the GPT-2 model and tokenizer.
- Padding token is set to the end-of-sequence token.

### Step 2: Apply LoRA Configuration to the Model
- LoRA configuration is defined with key parameters such as low-rank dimension and dropout rate.
- The LoRA model is applied to the base GPT-2 model.

### Step 3: Load and Tokenize Dataset
- The notebook uses the WikiText dataset.
- Tokenization is applied with padding and truncation.
- The dataset is converted into PyTorch tensors.

### Step 4: Fine-Tune the Model
- A PyTorch DataLoader is created for batching.
- The AdamW optimizer is used for training.
- Training loss is visualized over time.

## Common Mistakes

- Ensure that all required libraries and dependencies are installed before running the notebook.
- Verify that a GPU is available to speed up training.

## Best Practices

- Create a separate virtual environment for this lab to avoid conflicts with other projects:

```bash
python -m venv lora_env
source lora_env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
lora_env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

## Output

Upon successful completion of the notebook, you should:
- See a confirmation of successful model loading and dataset tokenization.
- Observe training loss values reducing over time.
- View a loss plot representing the fine-tuning process.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider:
- Reinstalling dependencies using `pip install --upgrade <package_name>`.
- Ensuring your GPU drivers and CUDA installation are correctly configured.
