# Fine-Tuning GPT-2 with Data Parallelism

This repository contains the materials for a micro-lesson on **Fine-Tuning GPT-2 with Data Parallelism**. The lesson demonstrates how to use PyTorch's `DataParallel` to distribute training tasks across multiple GPUs for faster and more efficient training.

---

## Lesson Overview

This micro-lesson is part of the "Foundations of Large-Scale Machine Learning" course. It focuses on teaching learners how to fine-tune a pretrained GPT-2 model using data parallelism on a small dataset.

### Learning Objectives
By completing this lesson, learners will:
1. Understand the concept of data parallelism and its role in distributed training.
2. Use PyTorch's `DataParallel` to fine-tune a pretrained GPT-2 model.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with PyTorch and Hugging Face's `transformers` library.
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts.

## Repository Contents

1. **Jupyter Notebook**: `fine_tune_gpt2_data_parallelism.ipynb`
   - A step-by-step guide to fine-tuning GPT-2 using data parallelism.
2. **Requirements File**: `requirements.txt`
   - Lists all the dependencies required to run the notebook.
3. **Hands-On Exercise**
   - Instructions for learners to practice fine-tuning GPT-2 using data parallelism.
4. **Quiz Question**
   - A multiple-choice quiz question to test understanding of data parallelism.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts between dependencies. Follow these steps:

#### For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv gpt2_env
gpt2_env\Scripts\activate
```

#### For macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv gpt2_env
source gpt2_env/bin/activate
```

Once activated, your terminal should show the virtual environment name (e.g., `(gpt2_env)`).

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmabboud/udacity_micro_lesson.git
cd udacity_micro_lesson
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Use the `requirements.txt` file to install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Open the Jupyter Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `fine_tune_gpt2_data_parallelism.ipynb`:
```bash
jupyter notebook fine_tune_gpt2_data_parallelism.ipynb
```

## Hands-On Exercise

The hands-on exercise involves:
1. Loading a pretrained GPT-2 model.
2. Tokenizing a small dataset (WikiText-2).
3. Using PyTorch's `DataParallel` to distribute training across GPUs.

Follow the steps in the notebook to complete this exercise.

## Quiz Question

**What is the main advantage of using data parallelism in distributed training?**

1. To split the input data across multiple GPUs for faster processing.
2. To reduce the size of the model to fit into a single GPU's memory.
3. To allow different GPUs to train separate models simultaneously.
4. To synchronize gradients during backpropagation across GPUs.

Correct Answer: Option 1  
Feedback: Data parallelism splits input data across GPUs, enabling faster training by processing smaller chunks in parallel.

## Next Steps

After completing this lesson:
1. Experiment with different datasets and prompts.
2. Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size.
3. Explore other distributed training techniques like model parallelism.
